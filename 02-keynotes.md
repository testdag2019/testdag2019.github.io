	<h5><a id="keynote1">Keynote: Bas Dijkstra -- <i>Why do we automate?</i></a></h5>

    <b>Abstract</b>:
		<p>Throughout my career in testing and automation, I've seen (and created!) a
		lot of horribly ineffective automation 'solutions'. I am slowly learning to
		do better, but I still see a lot of engineers, teams and even entire
		organizations that are spending a lot of time  and effort on automation that
		fails to deliver on its promises.

		In this talk, I'll share with you what I think is the key to doing better when
		it comes to automation. To better supporting our testing efforts with automation.
		To teaching people about automation in a more sustainable and future-proof manner.

		Are you wondering what that key looks like? I think it all starts with the 'why?'...</p>

	<b>Bio:</b> <p>I'm an independent professional helping teams and organizations improve their
		testing efforts through smart application of tools. I'm also a trainer on various subjects
		related to testing and automation. I live in the Netherlands with my wife and two sons.
		When I'm not working, I like to run or to read a good book (particularly British detective
		novels). You can contact me at  <a href="mailto:bas@ontestautomation.com">bas@ontestautomation.com</a>,
		on LinkedIn or via Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_basdijkstra?lang=en">@_basdijkstra.</a></p>

	<h5><a id="keynote2">Keynote: Marianne Duijst -- <i>Wearing Hermione’s Hat: Narratology for Testers</i></a></h5>

    <b>Abstract</b>:
		<p>When we find those pesky bugs in production, hindsight often allows us to see what logical leaps and assumptions we made, and how we could have caught it, had we only known. Narratology is study of the construct of stories. I’ll show how to apply its lessons to our software development and testing using examples from the Harry Potter narrative.
    Takeaways: (i) the basics of narratology: what it is and how to apply it to software development and testing;
    (ii) ways to reexamine your own assumptions and foster critical thinking;
    (iii) The building bricks of storytelling.</p>

	<b>Bio:</b> <p>Marianne Duijst works as an Agile Quality Coach at Sogeti, and held previous roles as a Tester, Software Engineer, Scrum Master, Developer and High School Teacher. She is a frequent speaker at testing conferences around the world and enjoys speaking about critical thinking, work culture and being a Girl Scout. She often sketchnotes to share and learn. Her love for IT and the Testing profession comes from a love for puzzles, logic, and structure mixed together with her creative, writing and crocheting mind. She loves to explore, meet people from different countries and cultures, read voraciously and dream outrageously.</p>
