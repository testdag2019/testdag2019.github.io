	<h5><a style="color:green" id="keynote1">Sander Hoogendoorn - <i>It's a small world after all: How thinking small is changing software development big time</i></a></h5>
    
        <b>Abstract</b>:
        <p>The world is changing fast. More precisely, the world is changing at increasing speed. This means things that were not possible five years ago come into reach. Incumbent organizations need to adapt fast to keep up with new competitors that use new technologies easier, faster and better than they do. As a result, every aspect of software changes towards smaller. Even smaller teams or even micro-teams, less management, flatter organizations, even shorter cycles, and smaller components.</p>
        <p>During this energizing and high-paced talk Sander discusses the Cynefin model, shows why software development goes so terribly wrong, how to move beyond Scrum and enterprise agile, why self-organization is not as easy as it looks like, why continuous delivery leads to not doing projects or estimates anymore and why microservices are hard but essential as underlying foundation.</p>
    
    	<b>Bio:</b><p>Sander Hoogendoorn is a dad, a freelance consultant, software craftsman, CTO, architect, programmer, post-agile coach, speaker, trainer, and writer. Seasoned in agile, Scrum, Kanban, continuous delivery, (no) software estimation, smart use cases, design patterns, domain driven design, UML, software architecture, microservices, and writing beautiful code.</p>
                   <!--<p>Sander helps organizations and teams to change and coaches them to optimize ways of working, practices, architecture, code, and tests. Currently, Sander is a chief architect at smart energy company Quby (makers of Toon). Before, he was a director with the agile consultancy 101 Ways, chief technology officer at software vendor ANVA and insurer Klaverblad. Earlier he operated as a global agile thought leader at Capgemini, and partner at consultancy Ordina.</p>
                   <p>Sander authored best-selling books such as This Is Agile and Pragmatic Modeling with UML and published hundreds of articles in international magazines. He is an inspiring (keynote) speaker at international conferences, he presented hundreds of (in-house) training courses and lectured at many universities. Currently, Sander is working on a new book about new organizations and teams - agile beyond agile.</p>-->

	<h5><a style="color:green" id="keynote2">Geoffrey van der Tas - <i>Quality Engineering: A new hope for Quality Software!</i></a></h5>
    
        <b>Abstract</b>:
        <p>Testing, Quality Assurance and delivering quality. It all radically changed over the
           last few years, all because of our new agile way of creating software. Now the
           latest evolution called DevOps has been taking the stage more & more in the last few
           years. Shifting more into automation and delivering software weekly or even daily.
           But how do you keep delivering high quality software that is tested in a proper way?
           How to prevent bugs from reaching your customers? Or even, how to keep them happy? 
           To answer these questions we will focus on the following points:</p>
        <p><ul><li>&#9656; What changes for the tester role</li><li>&#9656; How to build a high performing team that can focus on quality</li><li>&#9656; How to deliver quality from the start and have built-in quality</li><li>&#9656; Is there still a place for manual testing?</li></ul></p>   
        <p>During this fun & exciting presentation will include some nerdy jokes and practical
           insights on where you can start. Make sure to join this talk about "Quality
           Engineering: A new hope for quality Software!"</p>

                      of testing. He goes to many conferences to talk about Testing in DevOps and to do
                      workshops about BDD, Exploratory Testing & Resilience Testing. Besides
