20 November 2019 - Capgemini


The 25th edition of the Dutch Testing Day (Nederlandse Testdag) will take place on the 6th of November at the Capgemini head office in Utrecht.
For years, the Nederlandse Testdag has been the main event where science, education and the business world share new ideas and insights in the field of testing.  To form an exciting program we are <a href="/cfp/">calling for your proposals</a>!
