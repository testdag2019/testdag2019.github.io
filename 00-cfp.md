      <p>We are looking for different types of presentation proposals: <br/>
        &#9656; This could be a presentation about your testing methods, test techniques, new insights or test tools and experiences gained in your test projects. All consultants, project managers or quality managers and test strategists: please share your thoughts and experiences on how to achieve built-in quality.<br/>
        &#9656; Present the research project you are working on. All bachelor, master or Ph.D. students are explicitly invited to share their test research results. Even if the thesis is not ready for publication yet, we invite you to share your findings, to challenge the audience and to get feedback from your peers. <br/>
