<h5>From building quality to built-in quality</h5>
<p>Applications are being built faster and faster. New functionality is delivered in short iteration, using Scrum, Kanban or eXtreme Programming. Traditional methods of checking and verifying existing functionality, performance and security are no longer effective - and more: they are not fast enough.</p>
<p>Detecting and fixing errors in software that has already been built or delivered is time-consuming, slow and expensive. If we prevent errors, we are far more efficient.</p>
<p>The focus for Quality Assurance is therefore shifting to earlier phases in the Software Development Cycle - for example, to the software build phase. Modern development platforms with built-in tests and validations, or Citizen Development platforms claim to build software free of bugs. So the focus shifts to even earlier phases â€“ improving the specification and design using TDD or BDD. Or even earlier: identification of the expectations of end users - for example, by monitoring application usage & transactions in production environments.</p>
<p>Yet how can you facilitate and stimulate this shift as an organization? Which processes and (test) tools can guarantee and achieve built-in quality? How do you ensure that systems meet the (unspoken and changing) expectations of end users? What can Machine Learning and AI add to modern quality assurance? And what does this mean for our role as testers?</p>

<h5>Let's build an exciting program around the central theme "Built-in quality". We're looking for:</h5>

<ul class="collection">
  <li class="collection-item avatar">
    <i class="material-icons circle light-green">airplay</i>
    <span class="title"><i>40 minute presentations. Expect a seated audience in a conference room setting.</i></span> <br/>
      <p>We are looking for different types of presentation proposals: <br/>
        &#9656; Presentations about your testing methods, test techniques, new insights or test tools and experiences gained in your test projects.<br/>
        &#9656; Presentations on the research project you are working on. Even if your thesis or publication is not ready for publication yet, we invite you to share your findings!<br/>
      </p>
  </li>
  <li class="collection-item avatar">
    <i class="material-icons circle light-green">image</i>
    <span class="title"><i>15 minute 'Lightning Talks'. Shorter, more interactive sessions in the central exposition hall.</i></span>
    <p>These can be discussions on any topic - talks, comments, forecasts and predictions, anything goes, as long as it is related to the conference topic. If you want to demonstrate a new tool or technique you are working on and are looking for some honest feedback, this is the place to get it, too!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

All presentations and test talks can make use of a beamer and audio assistance.

<h5>How to submit:</h5>
Submit your proposal before September 15, 2019 to <a href="mailto:cfp2019@testdag.nl?Subject=Call%20for%Papers%Testdag%202019">cfp2019@testdag.nl</a>. Please include with your proposal:
<ul>
    <li>&#9656; Your full name</li>
    <li>&#9656; The organization or institute you're working in or for</li> 
    <li>&#9656; A contact email address</li>
    <li>&#9656; The title of your presentation. Make us curious!</li>
    <li>&#9656; A short abstract. Sell us your session!</li>
    <li>&#9656; Three takeaways people will get from your session. What do we walk away with?</li>
</ul>
